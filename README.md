# bible-memorization-project

A Springboot webapp, which will help me memorize Bible verses.

Proposed Features of the WebApp:
1. Search Feature
2. Add Verses to DB
3. View all the verses
4. Randomized quiz based on saved verses

The Bible(KJV) is stored and read from JSON. The verses to be memorized are added to a MySQL DB. The ListVerses / Quiz reads references from DB and displays them.
